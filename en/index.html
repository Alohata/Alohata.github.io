        <h3>Jaws, Maui</h3>
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peahi,_Hawaii" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">Peahi, Hawaii,</a> also known as Jaws (Pe’ahi in Hawaiian) is <b>the biggest and baddest surf spot in all of Hawaii.</b> With waves that are rumored to reach 120 feet, the reef break was largely inaccessible to surfers before the advent of tow-in surfing, led by Laird Hamilton. But the epic spot’s fame has brought an influx of inexperienced surfers, angering locals who must share precious real estate and worry about injuries.</p>
            
        <h3> Laniakea, Oahu </h3>
            <p>Oahu’s North Shore is home to some of <b>the world’s biggest waves</b>, and Laniakea may be the best point break on the coastline. Strong currents and the nearly exposed reef bottom at low tide make the spot dicey at times. <a href="http://www.northshore.com/hawaii/beach-lani.asp" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">Laniakea</a> is also renowned for the sea turtles that call it home, and the area draws about as many turtle watchers as surfers.
            </p>
            
        <h3> Banzai Pipeline, Oahu </h3>
            <p>When waves break onto the shallow reef at <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzai_Pipeline' target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">Banzai Beach</a>, they form some of the gnarliest tubes anywhere in the world. Newbies are advised to stay well clear of what is usually simply referred to as the <em>“Pipeline”</em> or <em>“Pipe”</em>, and even pros have met their end among its waves. Tahitian Malik Joyeux is just one of five surfers killed there in the past eight years.
            </p>
            
        <h3> Castles, Oahu </h3>
            <p>Originally known as <em>Kalehuawehe</em>, this spot was renamed for the home of Samuel Northrop, the 19th century missionary turned businessman whose “castle” was once a prominent Waikiki landmark. Castles is where Duke Kahanamoku, the Hawaiian who can be called the Babe Ruth of surfing (and five time Olympic medalist in swimming), reportedly rode a wave for more than a mile in 1917. His statue now graces the beach.
            </p>
        
        <h3>Ke’ei, Kealakekua Bay (Big Island)</h3>
        <p>Ke’ei Beach is one of relatively few great surf spots on Hawaii’s main island, and <b>is a surprisingly well-kept secret</b>. You won’t Jaws or Banzai-level waves here, but the underwater reef that stretches for 300 yards can provide long, consistent rides when the conditions are right.</p>
