            <h4>North shore of Oahu, Hawaii</h4>
                <p> Hawaii is undisputedly the home of surfing, hosting numerous world class competitions every year. The beaches are frequented by fanatic locals and dedicated surfers who make the pilgrimage to Hawaii wanting to surf the world's most famous waves.
                <p>The Ancient Hawaiian people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, hobby, extreme sport. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their culture and made surfing more of an art than anything else. They referred to this art as <em>heʻe nalu</em> - “wave sliding.”
